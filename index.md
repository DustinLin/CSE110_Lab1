# Dustin Lin's 110 Introduction Website

In the wise words of the lab 1 assignment this page function as:
>Introduces you as a programmer and as a person

## As a programmer
**VIM**, once you know you can never go back
Most familiar with JavaScript and ES6 shinanigans
Still uses a laptop instead of multiple monitors during stay-at-home COVID times
Thinks you are inhuman if you don't use dark themes.

```
console.log('hello internet')
```

#### Most recent project
Added a webscrpaer to my Discord bot to notify me when Brompton folding bikes are back in stock.
