# Dustin Lin's 110 Introduction Website

In the wise words of the lab 1 assignment this page function as:
>Introduces you as a programmer and as a person

## As a programmer
**VIM**, once you know you can never go back

Most familiar with JavaScript and ES6 shinanigans

Still uses a laptop instead of multiple monitors during stay-at-home COVID times

Thinks you are inhuman if you don't use dark themes.

```
console.log('hello internet')
```

#### Most recent project
Added a webscrpaer to my Discord bot to notify me when Brompton folding bikes are back in stock.


## As a person

Wakes up early for no apparent reason

Favorite video games: Pokemon Emerald, Ocarina of Time, Breath of the Wild

Please Nintendo come in clutch
